# List of Practice Programs

## Linked Lists:

1. [Code](https://github.com/vinitkesh/PD_Lab/blob/main/DSA_lab/code/LL1.c)
Implement linked list ADT with the following functions.  
    a. Insertion  
    b. Deletion  
    c. Display

3. [Code](https://github.com/vinitkesh/PD_Lab/blob/main/DSA_lab/code/LL1.c) Write a program to reverse a singly linked list.

4. Write a program to detect whether a loop exists in the linked list. The program should also
    print the starting node of the loop.

5. [Code](https://github.com/vinitkesh/PD_Lab/blob/main/DSA_lab/code/LL1.c)
 Write a program to merge two linked lists alternatively.

6. Write a program to merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted list.

7. Write a program to reverse a singly linked list in K groups:  
    Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the
    function).  
    **_Input_** _: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->NULL, K = 3_  
    **_Output_** _: 3->2->1->6->5->4->8->7->NULL_  
    **_Input_** _: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->NULL, K = 5_  
    **_Output_** _: 5->4->3->2->1->8->7->6->NULL_  

8. Write a program to sort the elements in a singly linked list using selection sort.

## Stack:

1. Implement stack ADT with the following functions using arrays
    a) Push (a)  
    b) Pop ()  
    c) Peek ()  
    d) Display  
2. Implement stack ADT with the following functions using Linked Lists  
    Push (a)  
    Pop ()  
    Peek ()  
    Display  
3. Write a program to evaluate a post fix expression
4. Write a program to convert an infix expression to a post fix expression
5. Next Greater Frequency Element: Given an array, for each element find the value of the
    nearest element to the right which is having a frequency greater than as that of the current
    element. If there does not exist an answer for a position, then make the value â€˜-1â€™.
    Example:  
    1) Input : a[] = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]  
    Output : [-1, -1, 1, 2, 2, 1, -1]  
    2) **Input :** a[] = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 11, 3, 3]  
    **Output :** [2, 2, 2, -1, -1, -1, -1, 3, -1, - 1 ]  
6. Next Greater element: Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every
    element. The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right
    side of x in the array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider the next greater
    element as -1.
Examples: 

    a) For an array, the rightmost element always has the next greater element as -1.
    b) For an array that is sorted in decreasing order, all elements have the next greater element as -1.
    c) For the input array [4, 5, 2, 25]  
        Output is [5, 25, 25, -1]  
    e) Input: [13, 7, 6, 12]  
        Output: [-1, 12, 12, -1]  

## Queue:

1. Write a program to implement Queue ADT with the following operations using Arrays
    a. Enque( a)  
    b. Deque()  
    c. Display()  
    d. Front()  
    e. Rear()  
2. Write a program to implement Queue ADT with the following operations using Linked Lists

    a. Enque( a)  
    b. Deque()   
    c. Display()  
    d. Front()  
    e. Rear()

3. Implement a stack using the queue data structure.
4. Implement a queue using the stack data structure.

# Takeaways/Solution : 

## Linked List :

### 3 pointer reversal :

```c
void reverseLL(){
    if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) {
        // Empty list or only one element, no need to reverse
        return;
    }

    node current = head;
    node prev = NULL;
    node next = NULL;

    while (current != NULL) {
        next = current->next;
        current->next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }

    // Update head and tail
    tail = head;
    head = prev;
}
```
