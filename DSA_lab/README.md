# List of practse problems for dsa lab

## Linked Lists:
1. []() Implement linked list ADT with the following functions.
a. Insertion
b. Deletion
c. Display
2. []()Write a program to reverse a singly linked list.
3. []()Write a program to detect whether a loop exists in the linked list. The program should also
print the starting node of the loop.
4. []() Write a program to merge two linked lists alternatively.
5. []() Write a program to merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted list.
6. []() Write a program to reverse a singly linked list in K groups:
Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the
function).
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->NULL, K = 3
Output: 3->2->1->6->5->4->8->7->NULL
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->NULL, K = 5
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->8->7->6->NULL
7. []() Write a program to sort the elements in a singly linked list using selection sort.

## Stack:
1. []() Implement stack ADT with the following functions using arrays
a) Push (a)
b) Pop ()
c) Peek ()
d) Display
2. []() Implement stack ADT with the following functions using Linked Lists
Push (a)
Pop ()
Peek ()
Display
3. []() Write a program to evaluate a post fix expression
4. []() Write a program to convert an infix expression to a post fix expression
5. []() Next Greater Frequency Element: Given an array, for each element find the value of the
nearest element to the right which is having a frequency greater than as that of the current
element. If there does not exist an answer for a position, then make the value ‘-1’.
Example: 1) Input : a[] = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]
 Output : [-1, -1, 1, 2, 2, 1, -1]
 2) Input : a[] = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 11, 3, 3]
 Output : [2, 2, 2, -1, -1, -1, -1, 3, -1, -1]
6. []() Next Greater element: Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every
element. The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right
side of x in the array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider the next greater
element as -1.
Examples: a) For an array, the rightmost element always has the next greater element as -1.
b) For an array that is sorted in decreasing order, all elements have the next greater element
as -1.
c) For the input array [4, 5, 2, 25]
 Output is [5, 25, 25, -1]
e) Input: [13, 7, 6, 12]
Output: [-1, 12, 12, -1]
## Queue:
1. []() Write a program to implement Queue ADT with the following operations using Arrays
a. Enque( a)
b. Deque()
c. Display()
d. Front()
e. Rear()
2. []() Write a program to implement Queue ADT with the following operations using Linked Lists
a. Enque( a)
b. Deque()
c. Display()
d. Front()
e. Rear()
3. []() Implement a stack using the queue data structure.
4. Implement a queue using the stack data structure.
